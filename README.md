# onion-software
A software that provides a graphical user interface (GUIs) to access a group of computational tools / big data tools

We developed a software called Onion. The Onion software aims to facilitate learners’ access to computational research tools without technical barriers. For this, it offers a graphical user interface, eliminating the need for command-line interfaces or scripting (e.g., Python scripts). Additionally, Onion serves as a ‘wrapper’ software, encapsulating various open-source computational research tools. While these tools are free to use, they do require some technical knowledge, such as using CLIs and basic Python scripting.  
There are two major sections in Onion. One focuses on retrieving posts from social media. The second one focuses on the analysis of the posts. 

The software (Windows version) can be downloaded via this link:
